/*
An online retailer sells five products whose retail
prices are as follows: 
Product 1, $2.98; 
product 2, $4.50; 
product 3, $9.98;
product 4, $4.49 and 
product 5, $6.87. 

Write an application that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:
1. product number
2. quantity sold

Your program should use a switch statement to determine the retail price
for each product. It should calculate and display the total retail value of all
products sold. Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the
program should stop looping and display the final results
